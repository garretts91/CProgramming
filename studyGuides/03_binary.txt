The Binary Number System 

1. binary numbers are represented as a sequence of binary digits called bits 
- a bit is the most basic unit of data that computers process 
- a bit can represent one of two values, 0 or 1

2. a computer is an electronic machine that consists of digital circuits 
- these circuits process groups of bits 
- in a digital circuit, bits can represent a state of ON or OFF 
- ON represents a high voltage level
- OFF represents a low voltage level 

3. a group of 8 bits is called a byte 
- a byte is the smallest addressable unit of computer storage
- the term addressable means that a particular byte can be retreieved according to its location in memory 

4. a group of 4 bits is called a nibble
- bytes consist of 2 nibbles: a high order nibble and a low order nibble 

5. a word is a contiguous group of byte
- words are any number of bits or bytes 
- word sizes of 16, 32, or 64 bits are most common 
- in a word-addressable system, a word is the smallest addressable unit of storage 
- many CPU's dont address memory as small as bytes 
    - ex. a 32-bit microprocessor is designed to address memory in 4-byte intervals 

6. the decimal system is a base 10 system 
- uses powers of 10 for each position in a number 
- binary is a base 2 system 
- uses powers of 2 for each position in a number 
- any integer quantity can be represented exactly using any base (or radix)
    - radix: In a positional numeral system, the radix or base is the number of unique digits, including the digit zero, used to represent numbers
        ex. for the decimal system the radix is ten, because it uses the ten digits from 0 through 9

7. base 10 number 115 is represented in binary as 01110011
bits            0       1       1       1       0       0       1       1
significance    128     64      32      16      8       4       2       1

8. reading and writing bits can become a bit tedious so computer scientists have developed a notation to represent groups of bits called the hex number system
- base 16 system 
- 0-9, A-F 

Hex     Decimal     Binary
0       0           0000
1       1           0001
2       2           0010   
3       3           0011
4       4           0100
5       5           0101
6       6           0110
7       7           0111
8       8           1000
9       9           1001
A       10          1010
B       11          1011
C       12          1100
D       13          1101
E       14          1110
F       15          1111
