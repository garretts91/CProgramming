Central Processing Unit (CPU)
- the CPU is the primary component that performs computer program execution 
- principle components:
    - Control Unit (CU) 
        - the CU is controlled by the system clock that synchronizes the activities of the CPU
        - a fixed number of clock cycles are required to execute each instruction 
        - clock frequency (measured in megahertz or gighertz) determines the speed of instruction execution 
    - Register Set (RS)
        - register set stores data and status information that is used by the CU and ALU (arithmetic and logical unit)
        - (depending on the CPU architecture) a typical register set contains 16-32 registers 
    - Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
        - carries out logicalm and arithmetic operations as directed by the Control Unit (CU)
    - Datapath
        - directs flow of data through the CPU's registers and arithmetic logical unit (ALU)\

Main Memory
- to store program instances loaded by the operating from secondary storage devices 
- to store data used by the program instances 

Secondary Memory 
- external storage devices that are used to store files 
- the files include:
    - executable program files 
    - data files and system software files 
        - system software files include: compilers, assemblers, and linkers

Input-Output (I/O) Subsystem
- I/O subsystem includes the address bus and data bus systems for transferring data to and from external devices 
- Data is transmitted over the I/O subsystem to:
    -
