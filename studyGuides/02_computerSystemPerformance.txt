Computer System Performance 

1. A programs execution time is determined by the following factors:
- the number of CPU clock cycles it takes to execute a program instruction (given as cycles per instruction (CPI))
    - the CPI is determined by the design of the CPU and the CPU's ISA (Instruction Set Architecure)
- the number of program instructions
    - determined by the CPU's ISA, the particular compiler used to compile, and the compiler settings 
- CPU clock speed 

2. CPU clock speed is measured in cycles-per-second (CPS) termed Hertz (Hz): 1 Hz = 1 Cycle per second 
- CPU clock speed represents the frequency of a clock tick 
- the frequency is the inverse of the clock period:
    - Frequency = 1 / Clock Period 
    - Clock Period = 1 / Clock Frequency 

3. CPU processor speeds are typically measured in megahertz (MHz) or gighertz (GHz)
    - 1 MHz = 1,000,000 Hz (1 million cycles per second)
        - Clock Period = 1 / Frequency = 1 / 1,000,000 = 1 x 10^-6 = 1 microsecond 
    1 Ghz = 1,000,000,000 Hz (1 billion cycles per second) 
        - Clock Period =  1 / Frequency = 1 x 10^-9 = 1 nanosecond 

4. A typical specification for a CPU's clock speed 
    - processor 11th gen intel(R) Core(TM) i5-1155G7 @ 2.50GHz

5. A programs execution time is given by the general performance equation:
    - CPU Time = seconds / program = (instructions / program) * (average cycles / instruction) * (seconds / cycle)

6. CPU throughput can be improved by:
- reducing the programs instruction count 
- reduce the cycles per instruction 
- reducing the clock cycle by increasing the clock speed 

7. Basic computer performance equation is useful in RISC vs CISC
- RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)
- CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer)
- (In general) to achieve better performance, 
    - RISC machines reduce the the number of cycles per instruction 
    - CISC machine reduce the number of instructions per program 

8. CPU efficiency is not the sole factor in overall system performance
- memory and I/O performance are also important 

9. performance benchmarking
- the science of making objective assessments concerning the performance of one system over another 
- price-performance ratios can be derived from standard benchmarks 
- (troublesome issue) there is no definitive benchmark that can tell you which system will run your applications fastest 
    - (using the least wall clock time) for the least amount of money 

10. Equating CPU clock speed with computer system performance is problematic 
- Saying System A is better than B because A runs at 1.4Ghz and B runs at 900MHz is only valid when:
    - ISA of A and B are identical 
- with different ISA's, it is possible that both systems could obtain identical results within the same amount of wall clock time 

11. The performance of a computing system is measured by the execution time of standardized system performance measurement programs
