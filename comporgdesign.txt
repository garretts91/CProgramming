Ch1 Computer Abstractions and Technology
1.1 Introduction
- Moore's Law:
    - the observation that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years
- WSC - Warehouse Scale Computers 
- "minimize memory space to make programs fast"
Primers:
- How are programs written in a high level language (C) translated into the language of the hardware? 
    - how does that hardware execute the resulting program?
- What is the interface between the software and the hardware?
    - how does software instruct the hardware to perform needed functions?
- What determines performance of a program? 
    - how can a programmer improve the performance?
- What techniques can be used by hardware designers to improve performance?
- What techniques can be used by hardware designers to improve energy efficiency?
- What are the reasons for and the consequences of the recent switch from sequential processing to parallel?
- (Since the first commercial computer in 1951) What great ideas did computer architects come up with that lay the foundation of modern computing?
- Look out for Understanding Program Performance 
    - performance of a program depends on the combination of the effectiveness of the algorithms used in the program
        - the software systems used to create and translate the program into machine instructions
        - and the effectiveness of the computer in executing those instructions (which may include I/O operations)
